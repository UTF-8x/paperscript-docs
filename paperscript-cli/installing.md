# Installing

There are a few different ways to install the PaperScript CLI.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since all Creation Engine games are officially Windows-only, Windows support is a priority for PaperScript. Other platforms are supported as well but with a lower priority.

Some features, such as running the papyrus compiler automatically are only available on Windows. The V2 built-in compiler will work on other platforms as well.
